# Homework: Documentation

For this assignment, your task is to define and document the functions
described below. Remember to start with two example expressions, then
follow the [steps].

- A function that applies the provincial and federal taxes to a given
  subtotal. In Quebec, the federal tax (GST) is 5%, and the provincial
  tax (QST) is 9.975%.

- A function that turns a given sentence into a question. A sentence
  always ends with a period, while a question ends with a question mark.
  Be careful: a sentence may contain other periods besides the final one
  (e.g.: "J.D. Salinger is an author.").

In addition to functions used before, you will need the built-in
function [string-substring]. Take some time to read its documentation,
and understand how it works.
