# Homework: Filtering

For this assignment, you task is to implement a function named
`repeated-word-count` that determines how many times a given word is
repeated in a given string. For instance, the word "more" appears twice
in the string "The more you practice, the more you learn".

> [!TIP]
> How do you know that "more" appears twice in the string above? What
> are the steps you go through for making that assertion? Can they be
> expressed in terms of the operations we've seen so far (e.g.,
> `string-split-all`, `filter`, `length`, etc.)?
