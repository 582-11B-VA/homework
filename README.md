# Homework

All homework assignments for this course must be submitted _before_ next
class, in your own homework GitHub repository, in separate files named
according to the name of the homework (e.g., "01_intro.arr").

If you don't have a GitHub account, [click here][signup] to create one.
You may use any email address, but make sure your username includes part
of your first or last name.

To create your homework repository, [click here][Classroom] and follow
the instructions. You will eventually be redirected to a repository that
matches your GitHub username (e.g., "homework_maximepigeon").

To submit an assignment, you first need to download your program from
Pyret (File â†’ Download). If you cannot see the "File" button, make sure
Pyret is connected to your Google Drive. Next, use GitHub's web
interface to upload your program to your homework repository: click on
the "+" or "Add file" button (left of the green "Code" button), choose
"Upload files", drag and drop your program, and click on "Commit
changes". If successful, you should see your program appear in the
repository.
