# Homework: Names

For this homework, your task is to write a Pyret program that displays
the Bangladesh flag, including its pole. Try to make it so we can easily
change the overall size of the flag. In addition to the functions used
previously, you will need `beside-align` and `overlay-onto-offset`. To
understand how these functions work, refer to the [documentation].
